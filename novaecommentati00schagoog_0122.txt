as so much rubbish.

Omissis iis quae non ad rem pertinere videntur Clarkii verba inde a

p. 42 exscribamus:

At the extremity of this chamber which is opposite ιο the window, a conside-
rable number of old volumes of parchment , some with covers and some without3
were heaped upon the floor in the utmost dlsorderz and there were evident procis
that these had been cast aeide and condemned to answer any purpose for which-
the parchment might be required. When we asked the Superior what they were,
he replied turning up his nose with an expression of indifference and contempt
Χειρόγραφα. 1t was indeed a moment in which a literary traveller might be sup‘·
posed to doubt the evidence of his senses3 for the whole of this contemned heap
consisted entirely of Greek Manuseripts and some of them were of the highest anti·
quity .............

The author (narrare pergit Clarkius) continued to inspect the heap; and had
soon selected the fairest specimen of Grecian calligraphy , which has deseended to
modern times( It was a copy of the twenty-four first Dialogues of Pisto written
throughout upon vellum in the same exquisite character-3 concluding with a date
and the name of the calligraphist. The whole of this could not be ascertained at
the instant. It was a single volume in folio, bound in wood. The cover was fun
of worms and falling to pieces3 a paper label appeared at the back inscribed in a
modern hand Διάλογοι Σωκράτουςε but the letters of Plato’s name separated by stare
appeared very distinctly ss a head-pisce ιο the first page of the Manuscript.

Glarkius cum librum pretiosum detexisset, nihil antiquius habuit, quam
ut eum aliosque libros manu scriptos emeret a monachis qua in re eius
operam maxime sublevavit Riley, natione Britannus. Quomodo autem libri ·

empti in possessionem Clarkii venerint, ipse his verbis narrat:

The whole of Sunday October thc eleventh was passed in great anxiety‚ being
the day on. which tiss Superior of the Monastery had engaged to send‘the remaining
manuscripts purchased by the author from the iibrsry. Hr- Riley had leit Patmos
for Constantinop103 and we began to sear, as the evening approached‚ thst his -
absence might become thepretext for a breach of eontract on the part of the monks.
Towards sunset being upon the deck of our caique and looking towards the moun-
tain we discerned a person coming down the steep descent from the Monastery
towards the pertz presently as he drew near, we pereeived that he had a large
basket upon his head and that he was coming towards the quay opposite to the
spot where our vessel was at anchei·t Upon his artival we saw him making signs
for a boat: and we sent to him the' little skiff belonging to our calque. As he
came a longside‚ he said aloud, that he had brought the bread ordered for us in con·
sequence of our letter fmm th'e Gapndan Pascha; but coming upon deek he gave
